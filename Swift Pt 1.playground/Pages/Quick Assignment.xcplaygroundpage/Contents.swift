//: ## TODO
//: Write a function that pluralizes words.
//:
//: * By default, it just adds "s" to the end.
//: * But there are some exceptions ("goose" -> "geese")
//: * Create a dictionary of exceptions, so I can look up "hoof" and get back "hooves".
//: * The function should first check the dictionary, to see if it has an exception, then fall back to appending "s"
